# Automated Data Processing with PyQGIS [Video]
This is the code repository for [Automated Data Processing with PyQGIS [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/automated-data-processing-pyqgis-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788390330), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
QGIS is a desktop geographic information system that facilitates data viewing, editing, and analysis. QGIS, paired with the most efficient scripting language, Python, enables us to write effective scripts that extend the core functionality of QGIS. Based on version QGIS 2.18, this book will teach you how to write Python code that works with spatial data to automate geo-processing tasks in QGIS. It covers topics such as querying and editing vector data and using raster data. You will also learn to create, edit, and optimize a vector layer for faster queries, re-project a vector layer, reduce the number of vertices in a vector layer without losing critical data, and convert a raster to a vector. Following this, you will work through recipes that will help you compose static maps, create heavily customized maps, and add specialized labels and annotations. As well as this, weâ€™ll also share a few tips and tricks based on different aspects of QGIS.
